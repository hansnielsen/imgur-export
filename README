This is a script that will export all of your imgur metadata.

1. Make sure you have Ruby 1.9.3 or later.
2. Make sure you have Bundler (http://bundler.io/) installed.
3. This command installs all of the other dependencies:
  $ bundle install
4. Copy imgur.rc.sample to imgur.rc
5. Register an app at https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps
6. Put the Client ID, Client Secret, and your account name in imgur.rc
7. This goes out to imgur and gets the metadata.
   Note that it will provide a URL and require two tokens.
   These tokens are visible in the URL after you authentication the app.
   $ ruby imgurexport.rb
8. You now have an export.json file with all of your metadata! Woo!
